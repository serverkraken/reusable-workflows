# Operations Runbook

Operational setup and maintenance procedures for the `serverkraken/reusable-workflows` catalog.

---

## 1. One-time GitHub App Setup

The catalog uses the `serverkraken-release-bot` GitHub App for release authentication. No PAT required; ephemeral 1-hour tokens are minted at runtime.

### 1.1 Create the App

1. Navigate to `https://github.com/organizations/serverkraken/settings/apps` and click **New GitHub App**.
2. Set the following permissions:
   - Contents: Read and write
   - Pull requests: Read and write
   - Issues: Read and write
   - Metadata: Read-only
3. Disable webhooks.
4. Set installation scope to "Only on this account".
5. Note the numeric **App ID** from the app settings page.

### 1.2 Install the App

1. From the app settings page, click **Install App**.
2. Install on the `serverkraken` org with access to **All repositories**.

### 1.3 Configure Org Secrets

Add both secrets as org-level secrets with **Repository access = All private repositories**, so downstream consumers reach them via `secrets: inherit`:

| Secret name                    | Value |
|--------------------------------|-------|
| `RELEASE_PLEASE_APP_ID`        | Numeric App ID (e.g. `123456`) |
| `RELEASE_PLEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Full PEM contents (including `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` header/footer) |

---

## 2. Actions Access Policy

The catalog repo must allow other private repos in the org to call its reusable workflows:

```bash
gh api -X PUT \
  /repos/serverkraken/reusable-workflows/actions/permissions/access \
  -f access_level=organization
```

Equivalent UI path: **Settings → Actions → General → Access → "Accessible from repositories in the 'serverkraken' organization"**.

---

## 3. Private-Key Rotation

Private keys are rotated **on suspicion of compromise**, not on a fixed schedule. Multiple keys can coexist on a GitHub App, enabling zero-downtime rotation.

### Rotation procedure

1. Go to the App settings page → **Private keys** → **Generate a private key**.
2. Download the new PEM file.
3. Update the `RELEASE_PLEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` org secret with the new PEM contents.
4. Trigger a release run (or wait for the next natural push to main) and confirm it succeeds.
5. Once one successful run is confirmed, return to **Private keys** and delete the old key.

No PAT-style 90-day calendar reminder is needed — key material doesn't weaken with elapsed time.

---

## 4. Renovate Dashboard

The catalog uses Renovate for dependency updates. Expect:

- **Weekly PRs** (before 6 AM Monday, Europe/Berlin): minor + patch updates for GitHub Actions, grouped.
- **Auto-merge**: minor and patch action updates auto-merge when the integration workflow passes.
- **Major updates**: never auto-merged; require manual review.
- **Fixture paths excluded**: `tests/fixtures/**` is excluded so intentionally outdated CVE/secret fixtures are not updated by Renovate.
- **Trivy CLI**: bumped via a `# renovate: datasource=...` annotation in the workflow YAML; the `customManagers` block in `.github/renovate.json5` handles this.

The Renovate Dependency Dashboard issue is created in this repo and lists pending/blocked updates.

---

## 5. Onboarding Workflow

`onboard.yml` (workflow_dispatch + workflow_call) adopts the catalog into other `serverkraken/*` repos. Reuses the existing `serverkraken-release-bot` App — **no new App setup, permissions, or org secrets required**.

### 5.1 Prerequisites

- `docs/onboarding-status.md` must exist. Initial seed (one-time): `scripts/seed-onboarding-status.sh` (requires local `gh` CLI authenticated against `serverkraken`).
- `serverkraken-release-bot` App is already installed org-wide (see §1.2).
- Catalog `main` branch protection must allow the App actor to push directly (already required by `catalog-release.yml`).

### 5.2 Dispatching an onboarding run

UI: **Actions → onboard → Run workflow**.

| Input | Notes |
|---|---|
| `target_repos` | Comma-separated `serverkraken/<name>` list. Validated against `^serverkraken/[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$`. |
| `language` | `auto` runs detection. Set explicitly to break detection ambiguity. |
| `dry_run` | `true` renders + logs diff, no PRs opened. Use for first-time verification. |
| `pin_version` | What `@version` the rendered templates pin to. Default `v1`. |
| `add_branch_name` / `cleanup_branch_name` | Escape hatches. Default branch names are bot-owned and force-pushed each run. |

### 5.3 What it produces

Per target, up to two PRs:

- **PR A** on `chore/onboard-reusable-workflows`: adds `ci.yml`, `release.yml`, `prerelease.yml`, `cleanup.yml`, `release-please-config.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json`. Always opened when the rendered diff is non-empty.
- **PR B** on `chore/remove-legacy-workflows`: deletes a curated list of legacy workflow names (`semantic-release.yml`, `docker-build.yml`, `trivy.yml`, `trivy.yaml`, `build.yml`, `publish.yml`). Only opened when at least one matches in the target.

### 5.4 Idempotency

Branches are bot-owned and force-reset to `default_branch` HEAD on every run. Empty-diff cases close any open PR on that branch. Re-running on a fully-onboarded repo is a no-op.

### 5.5 Manual acceptance flow (first run after a change to the workflow)

1. Pick one low-risk target (recommend a fresh throwaway repo first, then one of the smallest production repos).
2. Dispatch with `dry_run: true` — verify the step summary's diff matches expectations.
3. Re-dispatch with `dry_run: false` — review PR A in the target repo, merge it, push one `feat:` / `fix:` commit, verify the release-please PR opens and a release runs end-to-end.
4. Merge PR B once a release has run green.
5. Move to bulk: dispatch with a comma-separated list of all candidate repos.

### 5.6 Failure handling

`fail-fast: false` ensures one target's failure doesn't abort the rest. Each target's status is in the run's step summary and `docs/onboarding-status.md`. Re-running with the same inputs is safe and skips already-applied changes.
